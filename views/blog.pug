              p Meet Daisy the Golden Retriever, a 2-year-old ray of sunshine with a heart as golden as her silky fur! She’s the ultimate cuddle buddy, ball-chasing champion, and puddle-splashing pro who believes every stranger is just a friend she hasn’t licked yet. When she’s not proudly carrying sticks twice her size, Daisy loves long walks, belly rubs, and sneaking onto the couch for a snuggle. With her goofy grin and endless love, she’s here to brighten every day with tail wags and sloppy kisses! 🐾💛
